Outliers are unreasonable values, with normal outlier detection the entire dataset is deleted, showing data has strange distribution but is valid and should not be deleted 

Was originally using accuracy as metric, changed to cross validation and F1 score for a more telling evaluation


decreased amount of K and estimators tested to 1 - 30 (included)

removed 'sigmoid' and 'precomputed' kernel mode from SVM due to poor performance


Tried to test LinearSVC specifically after seeing 'linearì kernel was performing well (speed and accuracy wise)


Chose to test clustering algorithms due to the distribution of data. Will test K-means and GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model)
