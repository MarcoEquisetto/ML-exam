\noindent
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Star Classification dataset, with the aim of comparing multiple models' performances, how preprocessing data heavily impacts them and how models can be combined with each other to draw from strenghts and arrive to a better solution. Four different supervised learning models will be evaluated: \textbf{K-Nearest Neighbors}, \textbf{Random Forest}, \textbf{Support Vector Machines}(\textbf{SVM}) and \textbf{Logistic Regression}. Additionally, unsupervised learning techniques, specifically \textbf{K-Means} and \textbf{Gaussian Mixture Models} (\textbf{GMM}), are employed and applied to explore the intrinsic nature of the data. Model performance is mainly evaluated on F1-score for classification tasks and ARI and Sillhouette for clustering tasks.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\section{Motivation and Rationale}
\label{sec:motivation}
The classification of celestial objects is a fundamental task in modern astrophysics. With the advent of large-scale sky surveys, and the ever increasing amount of satellites and telescopes, the volume of spectral and photometric data has grown exponentially, creating the need to move from manual classification to machine learning models.

This project addresses the problem of classifying objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) into three distinct classes: Galaxies, Stars, and Quasars. The rationale behind this work is to compare the efficacy of distance-based, ensemble, and linear models in handling astronomical data, which is often characterized by high dimensionality and noise.

\section{State of the Art}
\label{sec:sota}
Astronomical classification has traditionally relied on the \textit{Morgan-Keenan} (MK) method, where each star has a spectral class and a luminosity class assigned to it. It has evolved from manual inspection to automatic pipelines capable of processing and handling data of orders of magnitude that are incomparable to those who were analyzed by hand. Current state-of-the-art methods generally fall into two categories depending on the input data format: ensemble methods for tabular photometric data and Deep Learning architectures for raw spectral or time-series data.\\For datasets consisting of extracted features (magnitudes, colors, redshift), much like the dataset treated in this project, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) are currently considered the gold standard, which is a good giveaway of why Random Forest Classifier (RFC) was the model which seemed to perform the best in this task as well.\\While tabular data with few selected features is efficient, the highest level of accuracy is obtained through the use of  "raw" data, these being mathematical data like \textit{1D-Spectra} (a combination of intensity and wavelength) or \textit{light curves} (brightness over time). Such data types are of complicated distributions and huge quantities, rendering them impossible to handle by simple Machine Learning models, and therefore more suitable for Deep Learning models, such as Neural Networks.\\Despite all the technological advancements, the field of stellar classification still faces many hurdles, mainly:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Imbalance}: The nature of the universe renders some objects much rarer than others (e.g. highly redshifted Quasars) and therefore data about said objects can be extremely hard to obtain, making it difficult to train models with equal representation of all classes.
    \item \textbf{Domain Shift}: Due to how much celestial object can vary both inter and intra classes, training a model on one dataset with labeled data from one survey and then applying it to another dataset might result in poor performance due to the presence of different level of noise profiles and instrument sensitivity, which is always inevitable when data comes from different sources in this field.
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning pipeline for celestial object classification and to find out which of the tested models better fits the task at hand. Specific objectives include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Preprocessing:} To implement effective outlier removal and feature engineering (calculating color indices like $u-g$) to improve model separability and to remove unwanted noisy features such as position based features (namely $alpha$ and $delta$).
    \item \textbf{Supervised Comparison:} To evaluate and tune hyperparameters for KNN, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression to find the best performing one for each of them.
    \item \textbf{Unsupervised Exploration:} To analyze the dataset using Clustering (KMeans, GMM) and assess the impact of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on clustering performance.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
All experiments were conducted using Python, utilizing the \texttt{scikit-learn}, \texttt{pandas}, and \texttt{seaborn} libraries specifically, combined with performance metric libraries. The single trainings of the various methods were developed separately and then brought together in one single train cycle, to uniform all of them and put all models in the same starting conditions, distribution and random seed generation.

\subsection{Dataset Description}
The dataset used is the \textit{Star Classification} dataset (sourced from Kaggle/SDSS). It initially contains 100,000 observations. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Original Features:} Spectral columns ($u, g, r, i, z$), redshift, various IDs, and spatial coordinates, namely $alpha$ and $delta$.
    \item \textbf{Target Class:} A categorical variable with three levels: \texttt{GALAXY}, \texttt{STAR}, \texttt{QSO}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction}
To prepare the data for training, the following steps were taken:

\subsubsection{\textbf{Cleaning:}} ID columns were dropped since they do not provide any real information and would very likely introduce biases or noise if kept.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Missing Values Check}}: Missing values introduce sparsity and reduce precision of models if many are present. In this specific dataset, the procedure did not detect any missing value, so no real removal action was performed.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Outliers Detection:}} Outliers were removed based on valid photometric ranges (e.g., removing rows where $u = -9999$).

\subsubsection{\textbf{Feature Engineering:}} The features had the following distributions:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figure_1.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Feature Distribution}: This plot visualizes how each of the post-preprocessing features is distributed inside each class. The most interesting feature is \textit{redshift}, as can be seen by its peculiar distribution with respect to the other ones.}
    \label{fig:distribution}
\end{figure}

And based on correlation analysis produced the following correlation matrix:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figure_2.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Initial Correlation Matrix}: The initial correlation analysis. It is noticeable how many features are highly correlated with each other. This denotes a need to act on them, deleting the highly correlated ones, which in this analysis were considered as having a correlation index higher than 0.9.}
    \label{fig:correlationMatrix1}
\end{figure}

As mentioned, this correlation matrix heavily implies some action needs to be taken to fix the high correlation between features.\\After deleting the correlated features and introducing the synthetic ones, the following new correlation matrix is produced:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figure_3.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Final Correlation Matrix}: The final correlation analysis. Features are now much less correlated and appear to be distint enough to be more than suitable for the following analysis steps.}
    \label{fig:correlationMatrix2}
\end{figure}

With this purification step completed, highly correlated features were removed. Synthetic features representing color indices were created:
\begin{equation}
    Color_{u\_g} = u - g, \quad Color_{g\_r} = g - r, \dots
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{\textbf{Scaling:}} A \texttt{StandardScaler} was applied to normalize features to zero mean and unit variance.


\subsubsection{\textbf{Dimensionality Reduction:}} For clustering analysis, PCA was applied to reduce the 
feature space to 2 principal components.


\subsection{Models Implemented}
The following supervised models were implemented using 5-Fold Cross-Validation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):} Tuned for $k \in [1, 50]$.
    \item \textbf{Random Forest Classifier (RFC):} An ensemble method, tuned for $n\_estimators \in [1, 50]$.
    \item \textbf{Support Vector Machine (SVM):} Using the RBF kernel, tuned for regularization parameter $C \in [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]$.
    \item \textbf{Logistic Regression:} Tuned for $C \in [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]$.
\end{itemize}

For unsupervised learning, \textbf{K-Means} and \textbf{Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)} were utilized, setting $k=3$ to match the known number of classes.


\section{Experiments and Results}
\label{sec:results}
The dataset was split into 80\% training and 20\% testing sets. The primary metric for model selection was the \textbf{Macro F1-Score} to account for potential class imbalances.
During development, problems arose, prompting solutions that would tackle and try to solve them with the goal of maintaining or bettering performances in mind. The following are the most important ones to discuss.

\subsubsection{The Redshift Feature}
 There is an important observation that needs to be made regarding the feature \textit{redshift}: when applying standard outlier detection methods, like GMM (good to detect outliers since if a point has a very low percentage to belong to any cluster it means it is an outlier) or using the 1.5IQR (Interquartile Range) rule, almost all points were being identified as outliers, indicating that data was multi-modal and therefore non-Gaussian. This meant that the IQR rule treated the variation between different classes (Stars vs. Quasars) as statistical anomalies. With this in mind, the entries were kept as valid data.\\Another extremely important observation that needs to be made is the influence that the \textit{redshift} feature has on performance of the models. By nature, celestial objects that emit light are highly characterized by this metric, and it is, in fact, a very telling feature: during development, it was discovered that even with minimal input on the dataset, performance on trained models that included this features were already on a degree of accuracy of above 0.97, effectively meaning that the logical correlation between the class of the object and the redshift feature was so high that it was almost as if the data remained labeled even after removing the class feature.\\For the purpose of the task, and in order to give myself more of a challenge, I decided to also drop \textit{redshift} from the features included in the training and testing dataset. By doing so, new challenges arose and classification became less trivial.

 \subsubsection{Synthetic Features}
 Removing the \textit{redshift} feature (too good at describing class) and $alpha$ and $delta$ features (position based features which have no meaningful information at all as to what object they refer to) meant that now the model only has color-based features to work with, namely:
 \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{u}: Ultraviolet filter in the photometric system
    \item \textbf{g}: Green filter in the photometric system
    \item \textbf{r}: Red filter in the photometric system
    \item \textbf{i}: Near Infrared filter in the photometric system
    \item \textbf{z}: Infrared filter in the photometric system
 \end{itemize}
 With some of these features being highly correlated with each other (as shown in [\ref{fig:correlationMatrix1}]), the new challenge was to find a way to work with the few remaining features and extrapolate meaningful data from them.\\This is when it was decided to create the following synthetic features:
 \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{u\_g:} $u - g$ (\textbf{Ultraviolet-Green Index}: Sensitive to hot, young stars and Quasar UV-excess)
    \item \textbf{g\_r:} $g - r$ (\textbf{Green-Red Index}: A standard measure of surface temperature for main-sequence stars)
    \item \textbf{r\_i:} $r - i$ (\textbf{Red-Near Infrared Index}: Useful for detecting cooler, redder objects like M-dwarfs)
    \item \textbf{i\_z:} $i - z$ (\textbf{Near Infrared-Infrared Index}: Helps distinguish high-redshift galaxies)
 \end{itemize}
 Introducing synthetic features meant models now had compound attributes with real-world physical meaning they could use during training and evaluation.

 \subsubsection{Pipeline Training}
Initially, data was scaled once after preprocessing and then given to all models. Mistakenly, I did not account for the fact that when \textbf{cross\_val\_score} splits \textbf{X\_train} into internal folds, the validation fold has already influenced the scaler (mean/variance) used on the training fold. This "peeking" can lead to overly optimistic scores.\\By adding a pipeline in training loops, this mistake was easily fixed and data leakage was prevented by scaling the entire training set before the cross-validation loop.


\subsection{Supervised Learning Performance- Hyperparameter Tuning and Evaluation}
Cross-validation was used to find the optimal hyperparameters by training loops: each model was given an incrementally higher hyperparameter to work on the same dataset as all its predecessors. This way it was possible to investigate performance based soley on hyperparameter and not on change of data. Every model will be discussed separately.

\subsubsection{KNearestNeighbour Classifier}
[DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL]

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figure_4.png}
    \caption{\textbf{K in KNN}: Graph shows how performance (F1-score) grows util a highpoint at $BestK = 15$, where it starts decreasing. In this case, there is a clear winner as for best hyperparameter value.}
    \label{fig:correlationMatrix2}
\end{figure}
Having obtained the best value for K, a new KNN model was trained specifically with this hyperparameter value to show evaluation metrics on the best version of KNN obtainable on this dataset. These were the obtained results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item F1-Score: 0.7760
    \item Accuracy: 0.8678
    \item Precision: 0.8402
    \item Recall: 0.8229
\end{itemize}
Below is the confusion matrix of KNN with $n\_neighbors = 15$:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figure_6.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Confusion Matrix}: This matrix shows how good the KNN model was at categorizing objects.}
    \label{fig:confusionMatrixKNN}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Random Forest Classifier}
[DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL]

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figure_5.png}
    \caption{\textbf{n\_neighbours in RFC}: Graph shows how performance (F1-score) grows.}
    \label{fig:correlationMatrix2}
\end{figure}
In this case, there seems to be an asyntotic behavior: even though the score increases, it does so ever so slowly, while training time and load increases with an inverse proportion. Taking both information into account, $n\_estimators = 96$ is assumed to be the best hyperparameter without continuing training loop. With this hyperparameter, a new training of RFC is made, which produces the following evaluation metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item F1-Score: 0.7590
    \item Accuracy: 0.8643
    \item Precision: 0.8368
    \item Recall: 0.8188
\end{itemize}
Below is the confusion matrix of RFC with $n\_estimators = 96$:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figure_7.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Confusion Matrix}: This matrix shows how good the RFC model was at categorizing objects.}
    \label{fig:confusionMatrixRFC}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Support Vector Machines}
[DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL]

Initially, all kernel instances were tested, namely $['linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid']$, only omitting $'precomputed'$ as it requires a specific size of matrix, each with hyperparameter C ranging in $[0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]$. Here is a plot that shows the performance of each kernel:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figure_8.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Performance of SVM}: Graph shows a comparison between kernel modes and how well they performed cycling through the $C$ values. It is apparent the best performing mode was $'rbf'$.}
    \label{fig:correlationMatrix2}
\end{figure}
The graph shows the best kernel mode was 'rbf', which is the expected result: this indirectly confirms that the data is not linearly separable and therefore a linear kernel mode could have never performed well enough to surpass its competitors. RBF has the highest performance because it can "bend" the separation line around data, better fitting the separation and achieving a higher precision and accuracy.\\The statistics that follow are the ones obtained by training a SVM with kernel mode 'rbf' and with $C = 100$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item F1-Score: 0.8135
    \item Accuracy: 0.8678
    \item Precision: 0.8402
    \item Recall: 0.8229
\end{itemize}
Below is the confusion matrix of SVM with $kernel=rbf, C=100$:

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figure_9.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Confusion Matrix}: This matrix shows how good the SVM model was at categorizing objects.}
    \label{fig:confusionMatrixSVM}
\end{figure}





\subsubsection{Final Metrics}
From the analysis that was conducted, out of all the models that were trained and evaluated, the winner, that is the model that achieved the best results, both in terms of accuracy and training time, is the $Random Forest Classifier$ model. Below is a small table summarizing the results of all models:

    \caption{Model Performance Comparison (Test Set)}
    \begin{tabular}{lcccc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Model} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{Precision (Macro)} & \textbf{Recall (Macro)} & \textbf{F1 (Macro)} \\
        \midrule
        KNN ($k=15$) & 0.8678 & 0.8402 & 0.8229 & 0.7760 \\
        Random Forest (n\_e = 96) & 0.8643 & 0.8368 & 0.8188 & 0.7590 \\
        SVM (Rbf, C = 100) & 0.8609 & 0.8397 & 0.8086 & 0.8135 \\
        SVM (Linear, C = 10) & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.6842 \\
        Logistic Regression & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:results}
\end{table}

\subsection{Clustering Analysis}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
% Requirements: Summarize goals, results, failure cases, future works [cite: 62-63]

In this project, we successfully implemented a multi-model approach to star classification. The Random Forest model proved to be the most robust, likely due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships in spectral data. The clustering analysis highlighted that while unsupervised methods can find structure, they struggle to perfectly align with the semantic classes (Star, Galaxy, QSO) without label guidance.

Future work could involve implementing Deep Learning approaches to further improve accuracy and reliability of the classification of cosmic bodies.
